# Student Digital Well-Being & Productivity Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes how digital habits such as screen time, sleep duration, stress level, and study habits affect student productivity. The analysis is performed using Python, SQL, statistics, and machine learning techniques on a self-generated dataset.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze the impact of screen time, sleep, stress, and study hours
- Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Apply statistical correlation techniques
- Build machine learning models to predict productivity
- Generate actionable insights for student well-being

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (SQLite/MySQL)
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset
Synthetic dataset containing:
- student_id
- screen_time_hours
- sleep_hours
- stress_level
- study_hours
- productivity_score

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regression

## 📈 Key Insights
- Excessive screen time reduces productivity
- Adequate sleep improves focus and efficiency
- Stress has a strong negative impact on productivity
- Study hours positively influence performance
